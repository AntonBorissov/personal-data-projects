This repository contains personal data analysis and sience projects.

## 2020 so far: are Reddit users more depressed than before?<br/>(Folder: Reddit Depression 2020)
This project explores the activity of several depression-related subreddits over the past three years and tries to answer the question if its user base has been more depressed lately.

The data was analysed and visualised employing a variety of Python librararies, sich as pandas and NumPy. Included is a Jupyter notebook with a fully annotated code, as well as interpretion of the results. Enjoy reading it.

The data was collected using the Pushshift API. Contact me if you need the complete dataset but also if you have any questions or notice inconsistencies with the analysis.

## Netflix content and IMDb scores: what are users watching?<br/>(Folder: Netflix and IMDb scores)
In this project, I used a Kaggle dataset containing all titles on US Netflix in 2019 and matched them with their respective IMDb scores from an external dataset.

I developed some sort of a matching algorithm that ensures that the titles are matched correctly and also results in less than 20% loss of data. I also explored the average IMDb scores accross several charactersitics, such as type and country of production, and then I visualised the association of the IMDb scores with other variables, such as movie length and release year.

Contact me if you need the matched dataset and/or if you have any suggestions for improving it.
